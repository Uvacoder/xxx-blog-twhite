This is a collection of software engineering-related articles, books and videos I have read or watch and recommend to others.

## 2023

### Articles 2023

- [Introduction to Operating Systems - Knowledge Bank](https://blog.securescape.cc/fundamentals/operating-systems/introduction-to-operating-systems): Learning how an operating system works, while not necessarily needed for red team/pentesting, it's recommended if you want to do malware creation and analysis. This is an excellent place to start.
- [Stack Exploitation - Crow's Nest](https://www.crow.rip/crows-nest/binary-exploitation/stack-exploitation): I have modeled this blog after Crow, as they are also a new cyber nerd. This is a good resource to hit up once you've learned about computer architecture.

- [Malware Analyst's Cookbook and DVD: Tools and Techniques for Fighting Malicious Code | Wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Malware+Analyst%27s+Cookbook+and+DVD%3A+Tools+and+Techniques+for+Fighting+Malicious+Code-p-9781118008294): So far, the best of the books I've downloaded and read.
- [The Antivirus Hacker's Handbook [Book]](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-antivirus-hackers/9781119028758/): very basic in its first few chapters so far. I've skipped large swaths of the beginning of the book as it goes over what Antivirus is and what it does and doesn't do. Most people should skip over these chapters.
