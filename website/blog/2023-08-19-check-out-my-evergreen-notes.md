If you've heard of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and you've heard of a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) then you're already halfway to understanding the premise.

<!--truncate-->

I don't want to call these a *digital garden*; too cutesy for me. I *would*, instead, like to call them *working notes*, much like [Andy Matuschak's](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), one of the greatest minds in computer science.

I used to talk a lot about productivity. I got zero work done. It's almost cultish, the way folks talk about it.

So instead of my notes being *[productivity porn](https://critter.blog/2020/08/06/productivity-porn/)* they're going to be a place for me to ramble about this cyber stuff. If you like them, you could reach out to me on Signal, or whatever.
