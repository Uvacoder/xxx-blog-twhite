This is a collection of software engineering-related articles, books and videos I have read or watch and recommend to others.

## 2023

### Articles 2023

- [Introduction to Operating Systems - Knowledge Bank](https://blog.securescape.cc/fundamentals/operating-systems/introduction-to-operating-systems): Learning how an operating system works, while not necessarily needed for red team/pentesting, it's recommended if you want to do malware creation and analysis. This is an excellent place to start.
- [Stack Exploitation - Crow's Nest](https://www.crow.rip/crows-nest/binary-exploitation/stack-exploitation): I have modeled this blog after Crow, as they are also a new cyber nerd. This is a good resource to hit up once you've learned about computer architecture.
